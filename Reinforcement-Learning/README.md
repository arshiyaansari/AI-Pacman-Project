# Part Three: Reinforcement Learning

In this part of project, I implemented value iteration and Q-learning.I tested my agents first on Gridworld (given in Berkeley code), then applied them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

Files that were edited to implement the search algorithms: 
- valueIterationAgents.py: A value iteration agent for solving known MDPs.
- qlearningAgents.py: Q-learning agents for Gridworld, Crawler and Pacman.
- analysis.py: A file to put answers to questions given in the project.

All other files were copied from CS 188: Introduction to Artifical Intelligence at Berkeley: http://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html

In this project, we implement reinforcement learning methods such as value iteration, bridge crossing analysis, varying policies, asynchronous value iteration, prioritized sweeping value iteration, Q-learning, greedy epsilon methods, etc.
