# Part Four: Ghostbusters

Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were not always so. Legend has it that many years ago, Pacman's great grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was blinded by his power and could only track ghosts by their banging and clanging.

In this project, I designed Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. I advanced from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency.

Files that were edited to implement the search algorithms: 
- bustersAgents.py: Agents for playing the Ghostbusters variant of Pacman.
- inference.py: Code for tracking ghosts over time using their sounds.

All other files were copied from CS 188: Introduction to Artifical Intelligence at Berkeley: http://ai.berkeley.edu/tracking.html
